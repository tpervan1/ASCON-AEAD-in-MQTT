# Ascon AEAD Cipher for MQTT Communication
Python implementation of the Ascon AEAD cipher for secure encryption and authentication of MQTT communication between a PC and an ESP8266 microcontroller.

This project demonstrates how to use the Ascon AEAD cipher to secure MQTT messages. Ascon is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms that provides confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. It is designed to be lightweight and suitable for constrained environments like IoT devices. Ascon has been selected as new standard for lightweight cryptography in the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition (2019â€“2023).

Implementation of the ASCON cipher functionality is based on [existing work](https://github.com/meichlseder/pyascon) from authors, with with modifications made to support MicroPython on ESP8266.
